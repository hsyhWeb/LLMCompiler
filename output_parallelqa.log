Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's five oceanic divisions, with an area of about 85,133,000Â km2 (32,870,000Â sqÂ mi).[2] It covers approximately 17% of Earth's surface and about 24% of its water surface area. During the Age of Discovery, it was known for separating the New World of the Americas (North America and South America) from the Old World of Afro-Eurasia (Africa, Asia, and Europe).. Through its separation of Afro-Eurasia from the Americas, the Atlantic Ocean has played a central role in the development of human society, globalization, and the histories of many nations. While the Norse were the first known humans to cross the Atlantic, it was the expedition of Christopher Columbus in 1492 that proved to be the most consequential. Columbus's expedition ushered in an age of exploration and colonization of the Americas by European powers, most notably Portugal, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom.

Context:
Main five oceans division:. The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth's five oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean, or, depending on the definition, to Antarctica in the south, and is bounded by the continents of Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.. At 165,250,000 square kilometers (63,800,000 square miles) in area (as defined with a southern Antarctic border), the Pacific Ocean is the largest division of the World Ocean and the hydrosphere and covers approximately 46% of Earth's water surface and about 32% of the planet's total surface area, larger than its entire land area (148,000,000Â km2 (57,000,000Â sqÂ mi)).[1] The centers of both the water hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere, as well as the oceanic pole of inaccessibility, are in the Pacific Ocean. Ocean circulation (caused by the Coriolis effect) subdivides it[2] into two largely independent volumes of water that meet at the equator, the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean (or more loosely the South Seas).

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67â94Â cm (26â37Â in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5Â m (3Â ft 7Â in and 4Â ft 11Â in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72Â kg (46 and 159Â lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98Â km/h (50 to 61Â mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40Â mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43Â mph) within 30 metres (98Â ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66Â ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820Â ft) of a race.[7][8].
math(what is the speed of cheetah in km/h if it was 1.3 times slower?)
Observation: 61.53846153846154
math(what is the speed of greyhound in km/h if it was 1.5 times faster?)
Observation: 105
Thought: Comparing the numbers, the greyhound was faster.
Action: Finish(greyhound)

Question: If Mount Everest's height were halved and Mount Kilimanjaro's height were doubled, what would be the difference in their height?
search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: à¤¸à¤à¤°à¤®à¤¾à¤¥à¤¾, romanized:Â SagarmÄthÄ; Tibetan: Chomolungma à½à½¼à¼à½à½¼à¼à½à¾³à½à¼à½; Chinese: ç ç©æçå³°; pinyin: ZhÅ«mÃ¹lÇngmÇ FÄng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The ChinaâNepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86Â m (29,031Â ft 82Â in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
search(Mount Kilimanjaro)
Observation: Mount Kilimanjaro (/ËkÉªlÉªmÉnËdÊÉËroÊ/)[4] is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895Â m (19,341Â ft) above sea level and about 4,900Â m (16,100Â ft) above its plateau base. It is the highest volcano in Africa and the Eastern Hemisphere.. Kilimanjaro is the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth.

Observation: 4444.43
math(what is the double of the height of Mount Kilimanjaro in meter?)
Observation: 11790
math(abs(4444.43 - 11790))
Observation: 7345.57
Thought: Difference in their height is 7345.57.
Action: Finish(7345.57)

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/sÉËhÉËrÉ/, /sÉËhÃ¦rÉ/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000Â sqÂ mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular á¹£aá¸¥ra' (ØµØ­Ø±Ø§Ø¡ /ËsË¤aÄ§ra/), plural á¹£aá¸¥ÄrÄ (ØµÙØ­ÙØ§Ø±ÙÙ /ËsË¤aÄ§aËraË/),[4][5][6][7] á¹£aá¸¥Är (ØµÙØ­ÙØ§Ø±), á¹£aá¸¥rÄwÄt (ØµÙØ­ÙØ±ÙØ§ÙÙØ§Øª), á¹£aá¸¥Är).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000Â sqÂ mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124Â mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550Â km (1,580Â mi) in length and 69Â km (43Â mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984Â Â±Â 25 metres (36,037Â Â±Â 82Â ft; 6,006Â Â±Â 14 fathoms; 6.825Â Â±Â 0.016Â mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2Â km (1.2Â mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086Â bar (15,750Â psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497Â mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480Â ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62Â mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55Â°25.12â²S 26Â°24.28â²Wï»¿ / ï»¿55.41867Â°S 26.40467Â°Wï»¿ / -55.41867; -26.40467ï»¿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909Â ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000Â mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Question: Considering the Atlantic Ocean with its area increased by 10%, the Pacific Ocean decreased by 5%, the Indian Ocean magnified by 20%, and the Arctic Ocean expanded by 15%, which ocean has the greatest area ?

search(Atlantic Ocean)
Observation: The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's five oceanic divisions, with an area of about 85,133,000Â km2 (32,870,000Â sqÂ mi).[2] It covers approximately 17% of Earth's surface and about 24% of its water surface area. During the Age of Discovery, it was known for separating the New World of the Americas (North America and South America) from the Old World of Afro-Eurasia (Africa, Asia, and Europe).. Through its separation of Afro-Eurasia from the Americas, the Atlantic Ocean has played a central role in the development of human society, globalization, and the histories of many nations. While the Norse were the first known humans to cross the Atlantic, it was the expedition of Christopher Columbus in 1492 that proved to be the most consequential. Columbus's expedition ushered in an age of exploration and colonization of the Americas by European powers, most notably Portugal, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom.

search(Pacific Ocean)
Observation: Main five oceans division:. The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth's five oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean, or, depending on the definition, to Antarctica in the south, and is bounded by the continents of Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.. At 165,250,000 square kilometers (63,800,000 square miles) in area (as defined with a southern Antarctic border), the Pacific Ocean is the largest division of the World Ocean and the hydrosphere and covers approximately 46% of Earth's water surface and about 32% of the planet's total surface area, larger than its entire land area (148,000,000Â km2 (57,000,000Â sqÂ mi)).[1] The centers of both the water hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere, as well as the oceanic pole of inaccessibility, are in the Pacific Ocean. Ocean circulation (caused by the Coriolis effect) subdivides it[2] into two largely independent volumes of water that meet at the equator, the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean (or more loosely the South Seas).

To the south it is bounded by the Southern Ocean or Antarctica, depending on the definition in use.[5] The Indian Ocean has large marginal or regional seas, including the Andaman Sea, the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the Laccadive Sea.. Geologically, the Indian Ocean is the youngest of the oceans, and it has distinct features such as narrow continental shelves. Its average depth is 3,741 m.

The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea.[2] It has also been described as an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean.[3][4] It is also seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing world ocean.. The Arctic Ocean includes the North Pole region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere and extends south to about 60Â°N. The Arctic Ocean is surrounded by Eurasia and North America, and the borders follow topographic features: the Bering Strait on the Pacific side and the Greenland Scotland Ridge on the Atlantic side.

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67â94Â cm (26â37Â in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5Â m (3Â ft 7Â in and 4Â ft 11Â in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72Â kg (46 and 159Â lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98Â km/h (50 to 61Â mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40Â mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43Â mph) within 30 metres (98Â ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66Â ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820Â ft) of a race.[7][8].

Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: à¤¸à¤à¤°à¤®à¤¾à¤¥à¤¾, romanized:Â SagarmÄthÄ; Tibetan: Chomolungma à½à½¼à¼à½à½¼à¼à½à¾³à½à¼à½; Chinese: ç ç©æçå³°; pinyin: ZhÅ«mÃ¹lÇngmÇ FÄng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The ChinaâNepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86Â m (29,031Â ft 82Â in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
search(Mount Kilimanjaro)
Observation: Mount Kilimanjaro (/ËkÉªlÉªmÉnËdÊÉËroÊ/)[4] is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895Â m (19,341Â ft) above sea level and about 4,900Â m (16,100Â ft) above its plateau base. It is the highest volcano in Africa and the Eastern Hemisphere.. Kilimanjaro is the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/sÉËhÉËrÉ/, /sÉËhÃ¦rÉ/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000Â sqÂ mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular á¹£aá¸¥ra' (ØµØ­Ø±Ø§Ø¡ /ËsË¤aÄ§ra/), plural á¹£aá¸¥ÄrÄ (ØµÙØ­ÙØ§Ø±ÙÙ /ËsË¤aÄ§aËraË/),[4][5][6][7] á¹£aá¸¥Är (ØµÙØ­ÙØ§Ø±), á¹£aá¸¥rÄwÄt (ØµÙØ­ÙØ±ÙØ§ÙÙØ§Øª), á¹£aá¸¥Är).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000Â sqÂ mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124Â mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550Â km (1,580Â mi) in length and 69Â km (43Â mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984Â Â±Â 25 metres (36,037Â Â±Â 82Â ft; 6,006Â Â±Â 14 fathoms; 6.825Â Â±Â 0.016Â mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2Â km (1.2Â mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086Â bar (15,750Â psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497Â mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480Â ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62Â mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55Â°25.12â²S 26Â°24.28â²Wï»¿ / ï»¿55.41867Â°S 26.40467Â°Wï»¿ / -55.41867; -26.40467ï»¿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909Â ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000Â mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
The PeruâChile Trench, also known as the Atacama Trench, is an oceanic trench in the eastern Pacific Ocean, about 160 kilometres (99Â mi) off the coast of Peru and Chile.[1] It reaches a maximum depth of 8,065Â m (26,460Â ft) below sea level in Richards Deep (23Â°10â²45â³S 71Â°18â²41â³Wï»¿ / ï»¿23.17917Â°S 71.31139Â°Wï»¿ / -23.17917; -71.31139) and is approximately 5,900Â km (3,666Â mi) long; its mean width is 64Â km (40Â mi) and it covers an expanse of some 590,000Â km2 (230,000Â sqÂ mi).. The trench delineates the boundary between the subducting Nazca plate and the overriding South American plate.. The trench is a result of a convergent plate boundary, where the eastern edge of the oceanic Nazca plate is being subducted beneath the continental South American plate.[1] The trench is also a part of the Chile triple junction, an unusual junction that consists of a mid-oceanic ridge and the Chile Rise being subducted under the South American plate at the PeruâChile Trench. Two seamount ridges within the Nazca plate enter the subduction zone along this trench: the Nazca Ridge and the Juan FernÃ¡ndez Ridge.. From the Chile triple junction to Juan FernÃ¡ndez Ridge the trench is filled with 2.0â2.5 kilometres (1.2â1.6Â mi) of sediments, creating a flat bottom topography.

Context:
The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000Â mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between the Indo-Australian plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Alpide belt as well as one of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].

Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124Â mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550Â km (1,580Â mi) in length and 69Â km (43Â mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984Â Â±Â 25 metres (36,037Â Â±Â 82Â ft; 6,006Â Â±Â 14 fathoms; 6.825Â Â±Â 0.016Â mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2Â km (1.2Â mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086Â bar (15,750Â psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.[citation needed] The temperature at the bottom is 1 to 4Â Â°C (34 to 39Â Â°F).[4].

 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67â94Â cm (26â37Â in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5Â m (3Â ft 7Â in and 4Â ft 11Â in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72Â kg (46 and 159Â lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98Â km/h (50 to 61Â mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40Â mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43Â mph) within 30 metres (98Â ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66Â ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820Â ft) of a race.[7][8].

The ChinaâNepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86Â m (29,031Â ft 82Â in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/sÉËhÉËrÉ/, /sÉËhÃ¦rÉ/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000Â sqÂ mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular á¹£aá¸¥ra' (ØµØ­Ø±Ø§Ø¡ /ËsË¤aÄ§ra/), plural á¹£aá¸¥ÄrÄ (ØµÙØ­ÙØ§Ø±ÙÙ /ËsË¤aÄ§aËraË/),[4][5][6][7] á¹£aá¸¥Är (ØµÙØ­ÙØ§Ø±), á¹£aá¸¥rÄwÄt (ØµÙØ­ÙØ±ÙØ§ÙÙØ§Øª), á¹£aá¸¥Är).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000Â sqÂ mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086Â bar (15,750Â psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497Â mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480Â ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000Â mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Observation: The PeruâChile Trench, also known as the Atacama Trench, is an oceanic trench in the eastern Pacific Ocean, about 160 kilometres (99Â mi) off the coast of Peru and Chile.[1] It reaches a maximum depth of 8,065Â m (26,460Â ft) below sea level in Richards Deep (23Â°10â²45â³S 71Â°18â²41â³Wï»¿ / ï»¿23.17917Â°S 71.31139Â°Wï»¿ / -23.17917; -71.31139) and is approximately 5,900Â km (3,666Â mi) long; its mean width is 64Â km (40Â mi) and it covers an expanse of some 590,000Â km2 (230,000Â sqÂ mi).. The trench delineates the boundary between the subducting Nazca plate and the overriding South American plate.. The trench is a result of a convergent plate boundary, where the eastern edge of the oceanic Nazca plate is being subducted beneath the continental South American plate.[1] The trench is also a part of the Chile triple junction, an unusual junction that consists of a mid-oceanic ridge and the Chile Rise being subducted under the South American plate at the PeruâChile Trench. Two seamount ridges within the Nazca plate enter the subduction zone along this trench: the Nazca Ridge and the Juan FernÃ¡ndez Ridge.. From the Chile triple junction to Juan FernÃ¡ndez Ridge the trench is filled with 2.0â2.5 kilometres (1.2â1.6Â mi) of sediments, creating a flat bottom topography.

search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000Â mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between the Indo-Australian plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Alpide belt as well as one of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
Mount Everest, known officially and locally as Sagarmatha in Nepal or Qomolangma in Tibet,[note 4]  is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The ChinaâNepal border runs across its summit point.[4] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86Â m (29,031Â ft 8+1â2Â in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[5][6]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the standard route) and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.

It has been the tallest tower in Japan since opening in 2012,[2] and reached its full height of 634 meters (2,080Â ft) in early 2011, making it the tallest tower in the world, displacing the Canton Tower,[3][4] and the third tallest structure in the world behind Merdeka 118 (678.9Â m or 2,227Â ft) and Burj Khalifa (829.8Â m or 2,722Â ft).[5][a]. The tower is the primary television and radio broadcast site for the KantÅ region; the older Tokyo Tower no longer gives complete digital terrestrial television broadcasting coverage because it is surrounded by high-rise buildings. Skytree was completed on Leap Day, 29 February 2012, with the tower opening to the public on 22 May 2012.[6] The tower is the centrepiece of a large commercial development funded by Tobu Railway (which owns the complex) and a group of six terrestrial broadcasters headed by NHK. Trains stop at the adjacent Tokyo Skytree Station and nearby Oshiage Station.

The CN Tower (French: Tour CN) is a 553.3Â m-high (1,815.3Â ft) communications and observation tower in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.[3][8] Completed in 1976, it is located in downtown Toronto, built on the former Railway Lands. Its name "CN" referred to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower. Following the railway's decision to divest non-core freight railway assets prior to the company's privatization in 1995, it transferred the tower to the Canada Lands Company, a federal Crown corporation responsible for the government's real estate portfolio.. The CN Tower held the record for the world's tallest free-standing structure for 32 years, from 1975 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa, and was the world's tallest tower until 2009 when it was surpassed by the Canton Tower.[9][10][11][12] It is currently the tenth-tallest free-standing structure in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure on land in the Western Hemisphere. In 1995, the CN Tower was declared one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67â94Â cm (26â37Â in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5Â m (3Â ft 7Â in and 4Â ft 11Â in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72Â kg (46 and 159Â lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98Â km/h (50 to 61Â mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40Â mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43Â mph) within 30 metres (98Â ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66Â ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820Â ft) of a race.[7][8].

The ChinaâNepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86Â m (29,031Â ft 82Â in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/sÉËhÉËrÉ/, /sÉËhÃ¦rÉ/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000Â sqÂ mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular á¹£aá¸¥ra' (ØµØ­Ø±Ø§Ø¡ /ËsË¤aÄ§ra/), plural á¹£aá¸¥ÄrÄ (ØµÙØ­ÙØ§Ø±ÙÙ /ËsË¤aÄ§aËraË/),[4][5][6][7] á¹£aá¸¥Är (ØµÙØ­ÙØ§Ø±), á¹£aá¸¥rÄwÄt (ØµÙØ­ÙØ±ÙØ§ÙÙØ§Øª), á¹£aá¸¥Är).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000Â sqÂ mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124Â mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550Â km (1,580Â mi) in length and 69Â km (43Â mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984Â Â±Â 25 metres (36,037Â Â±Â 82Â ft; 6,006Â Â±Â 14 fathoms; 6.825Â Â±Â 0.016Â mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2Â km (1.2Â mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086Â bar (15,750Â psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497Â mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480Â ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62Â mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55Â°25.12â²S 26Â°24.28â²Wï»¿ / ï»¿55.41867Â°S 26.40467Â°Wï»¿ / -55.41867; -26.40467ï»¿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909Â ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000Â mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

It has been the tallest tower in Japan since opening in 2012,[2] and reached its full height of 634 meters (2,080Â ft) in early 2011, making it the tallest tower in the world, displacing the Canton Tower,[3][4] and the third tallest structure in the world behind Merdeka 118 (678.9Â m or 2,227Â ft) and Burj Khalifa (829.8Â m or 2,722Â ft).[5][a]. The tower is the primary television and radio broadcast site for the KantÅ region; the older Tokyo Tower no longer gives complete digital terrestrial television broadcasting coverage because it is surrounded by high-rise buildings. Skytree was completed on Leap Day, 29 February 2012, with the tower opening to the public on 22 May 2012.[6] The tower is the centrepiece of a large commercial development funded by Tobu Railway (which owns the complex) and a group of six terrestrial broadcasters headed by NHK.

Observation: The CN Tower (French: Tour CN) is a 553.3Â m-high (1,815.3Â ft) communications and observation tower in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.[3][8] Completed in 1976, it is located in downtown Toronto, built on the former Railway Lands. Its name "CN" referred to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower. Following the railway's decision to divest non-core freight railway assets prior to the company's privatization in 1995, it transferred the tower to the Canada Lands Company, a federal Crown corporation responsible for the government's real estate portfolio.. The CN Tower held the record for the world's tallest free-standing structure for 32 years, from 1975 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa, and was the world's tallest tower until 2009 when it was surpassed by the Canton Tower.[9][10][11][12] It is currently the tenth-tallest free-standing structure in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure on land in the Western Hemisphere. In 1995, the CN Tower was declared one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
The Sahara (/sÉËhÉËrÉ/, /sÉËhÉrÉ/) is a desert spanning across North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000Â sqÂ mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[2][3][4]. The name "Sahara" is derived from Arabic: ØµÙØ­ÙØ§Ø±ÙÙ, romanized:Â á¹£aá¸¥ÄrÄ /sË¤aÄ§aËraË/, a broken plural form of á¹£aá¸¥rÄ' (ØµÙØ­ÙØ±ÙØ§Ø¡ /sË¤aÄ§raËÊ/), meaning "desert".[5][6][7][8]. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[1]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.

Context:
The Sonoran Desert (Spanish: Desierto de Sonora) is a hot desert and ecoregion in North America that covers the northwestern Mexican states of Sonora, Baja California, and Baja California Sur, as well as part of the Southwestern United States (in Arizona and California). It is the hottest desert in Mexico.[3]   It has an area of 260,000 square kilometers (100,000Â sqÂ mi).. In phytogeography, the Sonoran Desert is within the Sonoran floristic province of the Madrean region of southwestern North America, part of the Holarctic realm of the northern Western Hemisphere. The desert contains a variety of unique endemic plants and animals, notably, the saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) and organ pipe cactus (Stenocereus thurberi).. The Sonoran Desert is clearly distinct from nearby deserts (e.g., the Great Basin, Mojave, and Chihuahuan deserts) because it provides subtropical warmth in winter and two seasons of rainfall (in contrast, for example, to the Mojave's dry summers and cold winters).

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
The Kalahari Desert is a large semiarid sandy savanna in Southern Africa covering 900,000Â km2 (350,000Â sqÂ mi) including much of Botswana as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand Before Present, especially after 17,500 BP.[2].

 search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/sÉËhÉËrÉ/, /sÉËhÉrÉ/) is a desert spanning across North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000Â sqÂ mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[2][3][4]. The name "Sahara" is derived from Arabic: ØµÙØ­ÙØ§Ø±ÙÙ, romanized:Â á¹£aá¸¥ÄrÄ /sË¤aÄ§aËraË/, a broken plural form of á¹£aá¸¥rÄ' (ØµÙØ­ÙØ±ÙØ§Ø¡ /sË¤aÄ§raËÊ/), meaning "desert".[5][6][7][8]. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[1]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.

search(Sonoran Desert)
Observation: The Sonoran Desert (Spanish: Desierto de Sonora) is a hot desert and ecoregion in North America that covers the northwestern Mexican states of Sonora, Baja California, and Baja California Sur, as well as part of the Southwestern United States (in Arizona and California). It is the hottest desert in Mexico.[3]   It has an area of 260,000 square kilometers (100,000Â sqÂ mi).. In phytogeography, the Sonoran Desert is within the Sonoran floristic province of the Madrean region of southwestern North America, part of the Holarctic realm of the northern Western Hemisphere. The desert contains a variety of unique endemic plants and animals, notably, the saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) and organ pipe cactus (Stenocereus thurberi).. The Sonoran Desert is clearly distinct from nearby deserts (e.g., the Great Basin, Mojave, and Chihuahuan deserts) because it provides subtropical warmth in winter and two seasons of rainfall (in contrast, for example, to the Mojave's dry summers and cold winters).

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67â94Â cm (26â37Â in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5Â m (3Â ft 7Â in and 4Â ft 11Â in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72Â kg (46 and 159Â lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98Â km/h (50 to 61Â mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40Â mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43Â mph) within 30 metres (98Â ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66Â ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820Â ft) of a race.[7][8].

search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: à¤¸à¤à¤°à¤®à¤¾à¤¥à¤¾, romanized:Â SagarmÄthÄ; Tibetan: Chomolungma à½à½¼à¼à½à½¼à¼à½à¾³à½à¼à½; Chinese: ç ç©æçå³°; pinyin: ZhÅ«mÃ¹lÇngmÇ FÄng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The ChinaâNepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86Â m (29,031Â ft 82Â in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
search(Mount Kilimanjaro)
Observation: Mount Kilimanjaro (/ËkÉªlÉªmÉnËdÊÉËroÊ/)[4] is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895Â m (19,341Â ft) above sea level and about 4,900Â m (16,100Â ft) above its plateau base.

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124Â mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550Â km (1,580Â mi) in length and 69Â km (43Â mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984Â Â±Â 25 metres (36,037Â Â±Â 82Â ft; 6,006Â Â±Â 14 fathoms; 6.825Â Â±Â 0.016Â mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2Â km (1.2Â mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086Â bar (15,750Â psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497Â mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480Â ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62Â mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55Â°25.12â²S 26Â°24.28â²Wï»¿ / ï»¿55.41867Â°S 26.40467Â°Wï»¿ / -55.41867; -26.40467ï»¿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909Â ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000Â mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
The Yangtze or Yangzi (English:  /ËjÃ¦Åtsi/ or /ËjÉËÅtsi/ simplified Chinese: é¿æ±; traditional Chinese: é·æ±; pinyin: ChÃ¡ng JiÄng; lit. 'long river') is the longest river in Eurasia and the third-longest in the world. It rises at Jari Hill in the Tanggula Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau and flows 6,300Â km (3,915Â mi) in a generally easterly direction to the East China Sea.[8] It is the fifth-largest primary river by discharge volume in the world. Its drainage basin comprises one-fifth of the land area of China, and is home to nearly one-third of the country's population.[9]. The Yangtze has played a major role in the history, culture, and economy of China.

Context:
The Mississippi River[b] is the primary river of the largest drainage basin in the United States.[c][15][16] From its traditional source of Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota, it flows generally south for 2,340 miles (3,766Â km)[16] to the Mississippi River Delta in the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains.[17] The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.[18][19] The main stem is entirely within the United States; the total drainage basin is 1,151,000Â sqÂ mi (2,980,000Â km2), of which only about oneÂ percent is in Canada. The Mississippi ranks as the world's tenth-largest river by discharge flow, and the largest in North America.. Native Americans have lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries for thousands of years.

Context:
The Mekong or Mekong River (UK: /miËËkÉÅ/ mee-KONG, US: /ËmeÉªËkÉËÅ/ may-KAWNG)[1][2] is a transboundary river in East Asia and Southeast Asia. It is the world's twelfth-longest river and the third-longest in Asia[3] with an estimated length of 4,909Â km (3,050Â mi)[3] and a drainage area of 795,000Â km2 (307,000Â sqÂ mi), discharging 475Â km3 (114Â cuÂ mi) of water annually.[4] From its headwaters in the Tibetan Plateau, the river runs through Southwest China (where it is officially called the Lancang River), Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and southern Vietnam. The extreme seasonal variations in flow and the presence of rapids and waterfalls in the Mekong make navigation difficult, though the river remains a major trade route between Tibet and Southeast Asia. The construction of hydroelectric dams along the Mekong in the 2000s through the 2020s has caused serious problems for the river's ecosystem, including the exacerbation of drought.[5][6][7]. The Mekong was originally called Mae Nam Khong from a contracted form of Kra-Dai shortened to Mae Khong.[8] In Thai and Lao, Mae Nam ("Mother of Water[s]") is used for large rivers and Khong is the proper name referred to as "River Khong".

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67â94Â cm (26â37Â in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5Â m (3Â ft 7Â in and 4Â ft 11Â in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72Â kg (46 and 159Â lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98Â km/h (50 to 61Â mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40Â mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43Â mph) within 30 metres (98Â ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66Â ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820Â ft) of a race.[7][8].
math(what is the speed of cheetah in km/h if it was 1.3 times slower?)

search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: à¤¸à¤à¤°à¤®à¤¾à¤¥à¤¾, romanized:Â SagarmÄthÄ; Tibetan: Chomolungma à½à½¼à¼à½à½¼à¼à½à¾³à½à¼à½; Chinese: ç ç©æçå³°; pinyin: ZhÅ«mÃ¹lÇngmÇ FÄng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The ChinaâNepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86Â m (29,031Â ft 82Â in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
search(Mount Kilimanjaro)
Observation: Mount Kilimanjaro (/ËkÉªlÉªmÉnËdÊÉËroÊ/)[4] is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895Â m (19,341Â ft) above sea level and about 4,900Â m (16,100Â ft) above its plateau base. It is the highest volcano in Africa and the Eastern Hemisphere.. Kilimanjaro is the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/sÉËhÉËrÉ/, /sÉËhÃ¦rÉ/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000Â sqÂ mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular á¹£aá¸¥ra' (ØµØ­Ø±Ø§Ø¡ /ËsË¤aÄ§ra/), plural á¹£aá¸¥ÄrÄ (ØµÙØ­ÙØ§Ø±ÙÙ /ËsË¤aÄ§aËraË/),[4][5][6][7] á¹£aá¸¥Är (ØµÙØ­ÙØ§Ø±), á¹£aá¸¥rÄwÄt (ØµÙØ­ÙØ±ÙØ§ÙÙØ§Øª), á¹£aá¸¥Är).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000Â sqÂ mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124Â mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550Â km (1,580Â mi) in length and 69Â km (43Â mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984Â Â±Â 25 metres (36,037Â Â±Â 82Â ft; 6,006Â Â±Â 14 fathoms; 6.825Â Â±Â 0.016Â mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2Â km (1.2Â mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086Â bar (15,750Â psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497Â mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480Â ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62Â mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55Â°25.12â²S 26Â°24.28â²Wï»¿ / ï»¿55.41867Â°S 26.40467Â°Wï»¿ / -55.41867; -26.40467ï»¿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909Â ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000Â mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

'long river') is the longest river in Eurasia and the third-longest in the world. It rises at Jari Hill in the Tanggula Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau and flows 6,300Â km (3,915Â mi) in a generally easterly direction to the East China Sea.[8] It is the fifth-largest primary river by discharge volume in the world. Its drainage basin comprises one-fifth of the land area of China, and is home to nearly one-third of the country's population.[9]. The Yangtze has played a major role in the history, culture, and economy of China.

search(Mississippi River)
Observation: The Mississippi River[b] is the primary river of the largest drainage basin in the United States.[c][15][16] From its traditional source of Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota, it flows generally south for 2,340 miles (3,766Â km)[16] to the Mississippi River Delta in the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains.[17] The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.[18][19] The main stem is entirely within the United States; the total drainage basin is 1,151,000Â sqÂ mi (2,980,000Â km2), of which only about oneÂ percent is in Canada. The Mississippi ranks as the world's tenth-largest river by discharge flow, and the largest in North America..

search(Mekong River)
Observation: The Mekong or Mekong River (UK: /miËËkÉÅ/ mee-KONG, US: /ËmeÉªËkÉËÅ/ may-KAWNG)[1][2] is a transboundary river in East Asia and Southeast Asia. It is the world's twelfth-longest river and the third-longest in Asia[3] with an estimated length of 4,909Â km (3,050Â mi)[3] and a drainage area of 795,000Â km2 (307,000Â sqÂ mi), discharging 475Â km3 (114Â cuÂ mi) of water annually.[4] From its headwaters in the Tibetan Plateau, the river runs through Southwest China (where it is officially called the Lancang River), Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and southern Vietnam. The extreme seasonal variations in flow and the presence of rapids and waterfalls in the Mekong make navigation difficult, though the river remains a major trade route between Tibet and Southeast Asia. The construction of hydroelectric dams along the Mekong in the 2000s through the 2020s has caused serious problems for the river's ecosystem, including the exacerbation of drought.[5][6][7]. The Mekong was originally called Mae Nam Khong from a contracted form of Kra-Dai shortened to Mae Khong.[8] In Thai and Lao, Mae Nam ("Mother of Water[s]") is used for large rivers and Khong is the proper name referred to as "River Khong".

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
Mount Everest, known officially and locally as Sagarmatha in Nepal or Qomolangma in Tibet,[note 4]  is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The ChinaâNepal border runs across its summit point.[4] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86Â m (29,031Â ft 8+1â2Â in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[5][6]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the standard route) and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.

Mount Kilimanjaro (/ËkÉªlÉªmÉnËdÊÉËroÊ/)[3] is a dormant volcano in Tanzania. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest free-standing mountain above sea level in the world, at 5,895Â m (19,341Â ft) above sea level and 4,900Â m (16,100Â ft) above its plateau base. It is also the highest volcano in the Eastern Hemisphere and the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth.. Kilimanjaro's southern and eastern slopes served as the home of the Chagga Kingdoms until their abolition in 1963 by Julius Nyerere. The origin and meaning of the name Kilimanjaro is unknown, but may mean "mountain of greatness" or "unclimbable".

 search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest, known officially and locally as Sagarmatha in Nepal or Qomolangma in Tibet,[note 4]  is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The ChinaâNepal border runs across its summit point.[4] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86Â m (29,031Â ft 8+1â2Â in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[5][6]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the standard route) and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67â94Â cm (26â37Â in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5Â m (3Â ft 7Â in and 4Â ft 11Â in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72Â kg (46 and 159Â lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98Â km/h (50 to 61Â mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40Â mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43Â mph) within 30 metres (98Â ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66Â ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820Â ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/sÉËhÉËrÉ/, /sÉËhÃ¦rÉ/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000Â sqÂ mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular á¹£aá¸¥ra' (ØµØ­Ø±Ø§Ø¡ /ËsË¤aÄ§ra/), plural á¹£aá¸¥ÄrÄ (ØµÙØ­ÙØ§Ø±ÙÙ /ËsË¤aÄ§aËraË/),[4][5][6][7] á¹£aá¸¥Är (ØµÙØ­ÙØ§Ø±), á¹£aá¸¥rÄwÄt (ØµÙØ­ÙØ±ÙØ§ÙÙØ§Øª), á¹£aá¸¥Är).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000Â sqÂ mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124Â mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550Â km (1,580Â mi) in length and 69Â km (43Â mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984Â Â±Â 25 metres (36,037Â Â±Â 82Â ft; 6,006Â Â±Â 14 fathoms; 6.825Â Â±Â 0.016Â mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2Â km (1.2Â mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086Â bar (15,750Â psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497Â mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480Â ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62Â mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55Â°25.12â²S 26Â°24.28â²Wï»¿ / ï»¿55.41867Â°S 26.40467Â°Wï»¿ / -55.41867; -26.40467ï»¿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909Â ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000Â mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [ËkÉ¾istu Êedáº½ËtoÊ]) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98Â ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26Â ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92Â ft) wide.[1][2] It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.[3][4][5] Christ the Redeemer differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project organizers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide..

Context:
The Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue, with a height of 182 metres (597 feet),[3] near Kevadia in the state of Gujarat, India. It depicts Indian politician and independence activist Sardar Patel (1875â1950), who was the first deputy prime minister and home minister of independent India and an adherent of Mahatma Gandhi. Patel played a significant role in the political integration of India. The statue is on the Narmada River in the Kevadiya colony, facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam 100 kilometres (62 miles) southeast of the city of Vadodara.[4]. The project was first announced in 2010 by Narendra Modi, then Chief Minister of Gujarat, and construction started in October 2013 by Indian company Larsen & Toubro, with a total construction cost of â¹27Â billion (US$422Â million).[5] It was designed by Indian sculptor Ram V.

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
The Washington Monument is an obelisk on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., built to commemorate George Washington, a Founding Father of the United States, victorious commander-in-chief of the Continental Army from 1775 to 1783 in the American Revolutionary War, and the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797. Standing east of the Reflecting Pool and the Lincoln Memorial,[2] the monument is made of bluestone gneiss for the foundation and of granite for the construction.[3] The outside facing consists, due to the interrupted building process, of three different kinds of white marble:[4] in the lower third, marble from Baltimore County, Maryland, followed by a narrow zone of marble from Sheffield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and, in the upper part, the so-called Cockeysville Marble. Both "Maryland Marbles" came from the "lost" Irish Quarry Town of "New Texas".[5] It is both the world's tallest predominantly stone structure and the world's tallest obelisk,[A] standing 554Â feet 7+11â32Â inches (169.046Â m) tall, according to U.S. National Geodetic Survey measurements in 2013 and 2014.[B]  It is the third tallest monumental column in the world, trailing only the Juche Tower in Pyongyang, North Korea (560 ft/170 m) and the San Jacinto Monument in Houston, Texas (567.31 ft/172.92 m).[A] It was the world's tallest structure between 1884 and 1889, after which it was overtaken by the Eiffel Tower, in Paris. Previously, the tallest structures were Lincoln Cathedral (1311â1548; 525Â ft/160Â m) and Cologne Cathedral (1880â1884; 515Â ft/157Â m)..

Context:
The Motherland Calls (Russian: Ð Ð¾Ð´Ð¸Ð½Ð°-Ð¼Ð°ÑÑ Ð·Ð¾Ð²ÑÑ!, romanised:Â Rodina-mat' zovyot!) is a colossal neoclassicist and socialist realist war memorial sculpture on Mamayev Kurgan in Volgograd, Russia. Designed primarily by sculptor Yevgeny Vuchetich with assistance from architect Yakov Belopolsky, the concrete sculpture commemorates the casualties of the Battle of Stalingrad, and is the predominant component of a monument complex, which includes several plazas and other sculptural works. Standing 85 metres (279Â ft) tall from the base of its pedestal to its peak, the statue was the tallest in the world upon its completion in 1967, and is the tallest statue in Europe if including the pedestal. The statue, along with the rest of the complex, was dedicated on 15 October 1967, and has been listed as a tentative candidate for UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites since 2014.. The sculpture depicts a female personification of Russia, commonly referred to as Mother Russia.

 search(Christ the Redeemer statue)
Observation: Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [ËkÉ¾istu Êedáº½ËtoÊ]) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98Â ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26Â ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92Â ft) wide.[1][2] It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.[3][4][5] Christ the Redeemer differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project organizers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide..

search(Statue of Unity)
Observation: The Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue, with a height of 182 metres (597 feet),[3] near Kevadia in the state of Gujarat, India. It depicts Indian politician and independence activist Sardar Patel (1875â1950), who was the first deputy prime minister and home minister of independent India and an adherent of Mahatma Gandhi. Patel played a significant role in the political integration of India. The statue is on the Narmada River in the Kevadiya colony, facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam 100 kilometres (62 miles) southeast of the city of Vadodara.[4]. The project was first announced in 2010 by Narendra Modi, then Chief Minister of Gujarat, and construction started in October 2013 by Indian company Larsen & Toubro, with a total construction cost of â¹27Â billion (US$422Â million).[5] It was designed by Indian sculptor Ram V.

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67â94Â cm (26â37Â in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5Â m (3Â ft 7Â in and 4Â ft 11Â in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72Â kg (46 and 159Â lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98Â km/h (50 to 61Â mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40Â mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43Â mph) within 30 metres (98Â ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66Â ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820Â ft) of a race.[7][8].

search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: à¤¸à¤à¤°à¤®à¤¾à¤¥à¤¾, romanized:Â SagarmÄthÄ; Tibetan: Chomolungma à½à½¼à¼à½à½¼à¼à½à¾³à½à¼à½; Chinese: ç ç©æçå³°; pinyin: ZhÅ«mÃ¹lÇngmÇ FÄng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The ChinaâNepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86Â m (29,031Â ft 82Â in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
search(Mount Kilimanjaro)
Observation: Mount Kilimanjaro (/ËkÉªlÉªmÉnËdÊÉËroÊ/)[4] is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895Â m (19,341Â ft) above sea level and about 4,900Â m (16,100Â ft) above its plateau base. It is the highest volcano in Africa and the Eastern Hemisphere.. Kilimanjaro is the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/sÉËhÉËrÉ/, /sÉËhÃ¦rÉ/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000Â sqÂ mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular á¹£aá¸¥ra' (ØµØ­Ø±Ø§Ø¡ /ËsË¤aÄ§ra/), plural á¹£aá¸¥ÄrÄ (ØµÙØ­ÙØ§Ø±ÙÙ /ËsË¤aÄ§aËraË/),[4][5][6][7] á¹£aá¸¥Är (ØµÙØ­ÙØ§Ø±), á¹£aá¸¥rÄwÄt (ØµÙØ­ÙØ±ÙØ§ÙÙØ§Øª), á¹£aá¸¥Är).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000Â sqÂ mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124Â mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550Â km (1,580Â mi) in length and 69Â km (43Â mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984Â Â±Â 25 metres (36,037Â Â±Â 82Â ft; 6,006Â Â±Â 14 fathoms; 6.825Â Â±Â 0.016Â mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2Â km (1.2Â mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086Â bar (15,750Â psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497Â mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480Â ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62Â mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55Â°25.12â²S 26Â°24.28â²Wï»¿ / ï»¿55.41867Â°S 26.40467Â°Wï»¿ / -55.41867; -26.40467ï»¿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909Â ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000Â mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Question: If the height of the Christ the Redeemer statue decreased by 7%, the Statue of Unity increased by 6%, the Washington Monument increased by 5%, and the Motherland Calls statue decreased by 10%, what is the average of the shortest and tallest statues after these adjustments in meters?

search(Christ the Redeemer statue)
Observation: Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [ËkÉ¾istu Êedáº½ËtoÊ]) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98Â ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26Â ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92Â ft) wide.[1][2] It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.[3][4][5] Christ the Redeemer differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project organizers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide..

search(Statue of Unity)
Observation: The Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue, with a height of 182 metres (597 feet),[3] near Kevadia in the state of Gujarat, India. It depicts Indian politician and independence activist Sardar Patel (1875â1950), who was the first deputy prime minister and home minister of independent India and an adherent of Mahatma Gandhi. Patel played a significant role in the political integration of India. The statue is on the Narmada River in the Kevadiya colony, facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam 100 kilometres (62 miles) southeast of the city of Vadodara.[4]. The project was first announced in 2010 by Narendra Modi, then Chief Minister of Gujarat, and construction started in October 2013 by Indian company Larsen & Toubro, with a total construction cost of â¹27Â billion (US$422Â million).[5] It was designed by Indian sculptor Ram V.

search(Washington Monument)
Observation: The Washington Monument is an obelisk on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., built to commemorate George Washington, a Founding Father of the United States, victorious commander-in-chief of the Continental Army from 1775 to 1783 in the American Revolutionary War, and the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797. Standing east of the Reflecting Pool and the Lincoln Memorial,[2] the monument is made of bluestone gneiss for the foundation and of granite for the construction.[3] The outside facing consists, due to the interrupted building process, of three different kinds of white marble:[4] in the lower third, marble from Baltimore County, Maryland, followed by a narrow zone of marble from Sheffield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and, in the upper part, the so-called Cockeysville Marble. Both "Maryland Marbles" came from the "lost" Irish Quarry Town of "New Texas".[5] It is both the world's tallest predominantly stone structure and the world's tallest obelisk,[A] standing 554Â feet 7+11â32Â inches (169.046Â m) tall, according to U.S. National Geodetic Survey measurements in 2013 and 2014.[B]  It is the third tallest monumental column in the world, trailing only the Juche Tower in Pyongyang, North Korea (560 ft/170 m) and the San Jacinto Monument in Houston, Texas (567.31 ft/172.92 m).[A] It was the world's tallest structure between 1884 and 1889, after which it was overtaken by the Eiffel Tower, in Paris. Previously, the tallest structures were Lincoln Cathedral (1311â1548; 525Â ft/160Â m) and Cologne Cathedral (1880â1884; 515Â ft/157Â m)..

Observation: The Motherland Calls (Russian: Ð Ð¾Ð´Ð¸Ð½Ð°-Ð¼Ð°ÑÑ Ð·Ð¾Ð²ÑÑ!, romanised:Â Rodina-mat' zovyot!) is a colossal neoclassicist and socialist realist war memorial sculpture on Mamayev Kurgan in Volgograd, Russia. Designed primarily by sculptor Yevgeny Vuchetich with assistance from architect Yakov Belopolsky, the concrete sculpture commemorates the casualties of the Battle of Stalingrad, and is the predominant component of a monument complex, which includes several plazas and other sculptural works. Standing 85 metres (279Â ft) tall from the base of its pedestal to its peak, the statue was the tallest in the world upon its completion in 1967, and is the tallest statue in Europe if including the pedestal. The statue, along with the rest of the complex, was dedicated on 15 October 1967, and has been listed as a tentative candidate for UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites since 2014.. The sculpture depicts a female personification of Russia, commonly referred to as Mother Russia.

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

The Burj Khalifa[a] (known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration) is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft, or just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding antenna, but including a 242.6 m spire)[2] of  828 m (2,717 ft), it is the world's tallest structure. It has also held the record of the tallest building in the world since its topping out in 2009, surpassing the Taipei 101, the holder of that status since 2004.[3][4]. Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete and some of the structural steel for the building originated from the Palace of the Republic in East Berlin, the seat of the former East German parliament.[5] The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai.

The CN Tower (French: Tour CN) is a 553.3Â m-high (1,815.3Â ft) communications and observation tower in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.[3][8] Completed in 1976, it is located in downtown Toronto, built on the former Railway Lands. Its name "CN" referred to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower. Following the railway's decision to divest non-core freight railway assets prior to the company's privatization in 1995, it transferred the tower to the Canada Lands Company, a federal Crown corporation responsible for the government's real estate portfolio.. The CN Tower held the record for the world's tallest free-standing structure for 32 years, from 1975 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa, and was the world's tallest tower until 2009 when it was surpassed by the Canton Tower.[9][10][11][12] It is currently the tenth-tallest free-standing structure in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure on land in the Western Hemisphere. In 1995, the CN Tower was declared one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67â94Â cm (26â37Â in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5Â m (3Â ft 7Â in and 4Â ft 11Â in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72Â kg (46 and 159Â lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98Â km/h (50 to 61Â mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40Â mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43Â mph) within 30 metres (98Â ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66Â ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820Â ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: If Mount Everest's height were halved and Mount Kilimanjaro's height were doubled, what would be the difference in their height?
search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: à¤¸à¤à¤°à¤®à¤¾à¤¥à¤¾, romanized:Â SagarmÄthÄ; Tibetan: Chomolungma à½à½¼à¼à½à½¼à¼à½à¾³à½à¼à½; Chinese: ç ç©æçå³°; pinyin: ZhÅ«mÃ¹lÇngmÇ FÄng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The ChinaâNepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86Â m (29,031Â ft 82Â in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
search(Mount Kilimanjaro)
Observation: Mount Kilimanjaro (/ËkÉªlÉªmÉnËdÊÉËroÊ/)[4] is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895Â m (19,341Â ft) above sea level and about 4,900Â m (16,100Â ft) above its plateau base. It is the highest volcano in Africa and the Eastern Hemisphere.. Kilimanjaro is the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/sÉËhÉËrÉ/, /sÉËhÃ¦rÉ/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000Â sqÂ mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular á¹£aá¸¥ra' (ØµØ­Ø±Ø§Ø¡ /ËsË¤aÄ§ra/), plural á¹£aá¸¥ÄrÄ (ØµÙØ­ÙØ§Ø±ÙÙ /ËsË¤aÄ§aËraË/),[4][5][6][7] á¹£aá¸¥Är (ØµÙØ­ÙØ§Ø±), á¹£aá¸¥rÄwÄt (ØµÙØ­ÙØ±ÙØ§ÙÙØ§Øª), á¹£aá¸¥Är).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000Â sqÂ mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124Â mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550Â km (1,580Â mi) in length and 69Â km (43Â mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984Â Â±Â 25 metres (36,037Â Â±Â 82Â ft; 6,006Â Â±Â 14 fathoms; 6.825Â Â±Â 0.016Â mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2Â km (1.2Â mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086Â bar (15,750Â psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497Â mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480Â ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

search(South Sandwich Trench)
Observation: 55Â°25â²44â³S 26Â°11â²29â³Wï»¿ / ï»¿55.42889Â°S 26.19139Â°Wï»¿ / -55.42889; -26.19139. The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62Â mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55Â°25.12â²S 26Â°24.28â²Wï»¿ / ï»¿55.41867Â°S 26.40467Â°Wï»¿ / -55.41867; -26.40467ï»¿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909Â ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000Â mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Question: Given the height adjustments where the Ostankino Tower increases by 9%, the Burj Khalifa decreases by 6%, the Empire State Building increases by 3%, and the CN Tower decreases by 15%, what would be the average height of these structures after the adjustments in meters?

search(Ostankino Tower)
Observation: Ostankino Tower (Russian: ÐÑÑÐ°ÌÐ½ÐºÐ¸Ð½ÑÐºÐ°Ñ ÑÐµÐ»ÐµÐ±Ð°ÌÑÐ½Ñ, romanized:Â Ostankinskaya telebashnya) is a television and radio tower in Moscow, Russia, owned by the Moscow branch of unitary enterprise Russian TV and Radio Broadcasting Network. Standing 540.1 metres (1,772Â ft), it was designed by Nikolai Nikitin. As of 2022[update], it is the tallest free-standing structure in Europe and 15th tallest in the world. Between 1967 and 1974, it was the tallest in the world. The tower was the first free-standing structure to exceed 500Â m (1,600Â ft) in height.
math(Ostankino Tower height in meters if increased by 9%?)
Observation: 588.709
search(Burj Khalifa)
Observation: The Burj Khalifa[a] (known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration) is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft, or just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding antenna, but including a 242.6 m spire)[2] of  828 m (2,717 ft), it is the world's tallest structure. It has also held the record of the tallest building in the world since its topping out in 2009, surpassing the Taipei 101, the holder of that status since 2004.[3][4]. Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete and some of the structural steel for the building originated from the Palace of the Republic in East Berlin, the seat of the former East German parliament.[5] The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai.

Observation: 780.012
search(Empire State Building)
Observation: The Empire State Building is a 102-story,[c] Art Deco-style supertall skyscraper in the Midtown South neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. The building was designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon and built from 1930 to 1931. Its name is derived from "Empire State", the nickname of the state of New York. The building has a roof height of 1,250 feet (380Â m) and stands a total of 1,454 feet (443.2Â m) tall, including its antenna. The Empire State Building was the world's tallest building until the first tower of the World Trade Center was topped out in 1970; following the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Empire State Building was once more New York City's tallest building until it was surpassed in 2012 by One World Trade Center.

search(CN Tower)
Observation: The CN Tower (French: Tour CN) is a 553.3Â m-high (1,815.3Â ft) communications and observation tower in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.[3][8] Completed in 1976, it is located in downtown Toronto, built on the former Railway Lands. Its name "CN" referred to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower. Following the railway's decision to divest non-core freight railway assets prior to the company's privatization in 1995, it transferred the tower to the Canada Lands Company, a federal Crown corporation responsible for the government's real estate portfolio.. The CN Tower held the record for the world's tallest free-standing structure for 32 years, from 1975 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa, and was the world's tallest tower until 2009 when it was surpassed by the Canton Tower.[9][10][11][12] It is currently the tenth-tallest free-standing structure in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure on land in the Western Hemisphere. In 1995, the CN Tower was declared one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
The Amazon rainforest,[a] also called the Amazon jungle or Amazonia, is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000Â km2 (2,700,000Â sqÂ mi),[2] of which 6,000,000Â km2 (2,300,000Â sqÂ mi) are covered by the rainforest.[3] This region includes territory belonging to nine nations and 3,344 indigenous territories.. The majority of the forest, 60%, is in Brazil, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. Four nations have "Amazonas" as the name of one of their first-level administrative regions, and France uses the name "Guiana Amazonian Park" for French Guiana's protected rainforest area. The Amazon represents over half of the total area of remaining rainforests on Earth,[4] and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees in about 16,000 species.[5].

Context:
The Black Forest (German: Schwarzwald [ËÊvaÊtsvalt] â) is a large forested mountain range in the state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg in southwest Germany, bounded by the Rhine Valley to the west and south and close to the borders with France and Switzerland.[1] It is the source of the Danube and Neckar rivers.. Its highest peak is the Feldberg with an elevation of 1,493 metres (4,898Â ft) above sea level. Roughly oblong in shape, with a length of 160 kilometres (100 miles) and breadth of up to 50Â km (30Â mi),[2] it has an area of about 6,009Â km2 (2,320Â sqÂ mi).[1]. Historically, the area was known for forestry and the mining of ore deposits, but tourism has now become the primary industry, accounting for around 300,000 jobs.[3] There are several ruined military fortifications dating back to the 17th century.[4]. In ancient times, the Black Forest was known as Abnoba mons, after the Celtic deity, Abnoba.

ValueError: unknown format from LLM: To answer the question, we need to know the original area of the Borneo Rainforest in kmÂ². However, the context provided does not include this specific numerical value. Without the original area, it's impossible to calculate the reduced area by 15%. 

If you can provide the original area of the Borneo Rainforest in kmÂ², I can then compute the reduced area. For example, if the original area was 100,000 kmÂ², the calculation would be:

```text
100000 * 0.85
```
...numexpr.evaluate("100000 * 0.85")...
