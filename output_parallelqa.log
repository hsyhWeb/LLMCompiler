Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.[citation needed] The temperature at the bottom is 1 to 4 °C (34 to 39 °F).[4].

Context:
The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the North Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, parallel to and north of Puerto Rico, where the oceanic trench reaches the deepest points in the Atlantic Ocean. The trench is associated with a complex transition from the Lesser Antilles frontal subduction zone between the South American plate and Caribbean plate to the oblique subduction zone and the strike-slip transform fault zone between the North American plate and Caribbean plate, which extends from the Puerto Rico Trench at the Puerto Rico–Virgin Islands microplate through the Cayman Trough at the Gonâve microplate to the Middle America Trench at the Cocos plate.[1][2][3][4][5][6]. Constituting the deepest points in the Atlantic Ocean, the trench is 810 kilometres (503 mi) long[7] and has a maximum documented depth between  8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[8] and 8,740 metres (28,675 ft).[7][9] The deepest point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[10] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[11][12][13] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[14][15][16]. Scientific studies have concluded that an earthquake occurring along this fault zone could generate a significant tsunami.[17] The island of Puerto Rico, which lies immediately to the south of the fault zone and the trench, suffered a destructive tsunami soon after the 1918 San Fermín earthquake.. The Puerto Rico Trench is located at a boundary between two plates that pass each other along a transform boundary with only a small component of subduction.

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: If Mount Everest's height were halved and Mount Kilimanjaro's height were doubled, what would be the difference in their height?
search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 82 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
search(Mount Kilimanjaro)
Observation: Mount Kilimanjaro (/ˌkɪlɪmənˈdʒɑːroʊ/)[4] is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895 m (19,341 ft) above sea level and about 4,900 m (16,100 ft) above its plateau base. It is the highest volcano in Africa and the Eastern Hemisphere.. Kilimanjaro is the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Constituting the deepest points in the Atlantic Ocean, the trench is 810 kilometres (503 mi) long[7] and has a maximum documented depth between  8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[8] and 8,740 metres (28,675 ft).[7][9] The deepest point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[10] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[11][12][13] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[14][15][16]. Scientific studies have concluded that an earthquake occurring along this fault zone could generate a significant tsunami.[17] The island of Puerto Rico, which lies immediately to the south of the fault zone and the trench, suffered a destructive tsunami soon after the 1918 San Fermín earthquake.. The Puerto Rico Trench is located at a boundary between two plates that pass each other along a transform boundary with only a small component of subduction.

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat and the fastest land animal. It has a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. The head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 65 kg (46 and 143 lb).

Question: cheetah max speed in km/h if 20% faster?

[32;1m[1;3mTo find the cheetah's maximum speed when it is 20% faster, we first need to know the cheetah's current maximum speed from the context. However, the provided context does not mention the cheetah's speed. 

Since the context does not provide the necessary information (the current maximum speed of the cheetah), we cannot compute the answer. 

Please provide the cheetah's current maximum speed in the context.

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: If Mount Everest's height were halved and Mount Kilimanjaro's height were doubled, what would be the difference in their height?
search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 82 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
search(Mount Kilimanjaro)
Observation: Mount Kilimanjaro (/ˌkɪlɪmənˈdʒɑːroʊ/)[4] is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895 m (19,341 ft) above sea level and about 4,900 m (16,100 ft) above its plateau base. It is the highest volcano in Africa and the Eastern Hemisphere.. Kilimanjaro is the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhɛrə/) is a desert spanning across North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[2][3][4]. The name "Sahara" is derived from Arabic: صَحَارَى, romanized: ṣaḥārā /sˤaħaːraː/, a broken plural form of ṣaḥrā' (صَحْرَاء /sˤaħraːʔ/), meaning "desert".[5][6][7][8]. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[1]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.

The Kalahari Desert is a large semiarid sandy savanna in Southern Africa covering 900,000 km2 (350,000 sq mi) including much of Botswana as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert.

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: If Mount Everest's height were halved and Mount Kilimanjaro's height were doubled, what would be the difference in their height?
search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 82 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
search(Mount Kilimanjaro)
Observation: Mount Kilimanjaro (/ˌkɪlɪmənˈdʒɑːroʊ/)[4] is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895 m (19,341 ft) above sea level and about 4,900 m (16,100 ft) above its plateau base.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8].

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
The Yangtze or Yangzi (English:  /ˈjæŋtsi/ or /ˈjɑːŋtsi/ simplified Chinese: 长江; traditional Chinese: 長江; pinyin: Cháng Jiāng; lit. 'long river') is the longest river in Eurasia and the third-longest in the world. It rises at Jari Hill in the Tanggula Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau and flows 6,300 km (3,915 mi) in a generally easterly direction to the East China Sea.[8] It is the fifth-largest primary river by discharge volume in the world. Its drainage basin comprises one-fifth of the land area of China, and is home to nearly one-third of the country's population.[9]. The Yangtze has played a major role in the history, culture, and economy of China.

Context:
The Mississippi River[b] is the primary river of the largest drainage basin in the United States.[c][15][16] From its traditional source of Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota, it flows generally south for 2,340 miles (3,766 km)[16] to the Mississippi River Delta in the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains.[17] The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.[18][19] The main stem is entirely within the United States; the total drainage basin is 1,151,000 sq mi (2,980,000 km2), of which only about one percent is in Canada. The Mississippi ranks as the world's tenth-largest river by discharge flow, and the largest in North America.. Native Americans have lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries for thousands of years.

 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: If Mount Everest's height were halved and Mount Kilimanjaro's height were doubled, what would be the difference in their height?
search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 82 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
search(Mount Kilimanjaro)
Observation: Mount Kilimanjaro (/ˌkɪlɪmənˈdʒɑːroʊ/)[4] is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895 m (19,341 ft) above sea level and about 4,900 m (16,100 ft) above its plateau base.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

Observation: 55°25′44″S 26°11′29″W﻿ / ﻿55.42889°S 26.19139°W﻿ / -55.42889; -26.19139. The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: If Mount Everest's height were halved and Mount Kilimanjaro's height were doubled, what would be the difference in their height?
search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 82 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈkɾistu ʁedẽˈtoʁ]) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.[1][2] It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.[3][4][5] Christ the Redeemer differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project organizers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide..

Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Question: After increasing the height of Christ the Redeemer by 60% and decreasing the height of the Statue of Unity by 30%, which statue would dominate in height?

search(Christ the Redeemer)
Observation: Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈkɾistu ʁedẽˈtoʁ]) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.[1][2] It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.[3][4][5] Christ the Redeemer differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project organizers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide..

Observation: The Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue, with a height of 182 metres (597 feet),[3] near Kevadia in the state of Gujarat, India. It depicts Indian politician and independence activist Sardar Patel (1875–1950), who was the first deputy prime minister and home minister of independent India and an adherent of Mahatma Gandhi. Patel played a significant role in the political integration of India. The statue is on the Narmada River in the Kevadiya colony, facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam 100 kilometres (62 miles) southeast of the city of Vadodara.[4]. The project was first announced in 2010 by Narendra Modi, then Chief Minister of Gujarat, and construction started in October 2013 by Indian company Larsen & Toubro, with a total construction cost of ₹27 billion (US$422 million).[5] It was designed by Indian sculptor Ram V.

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 82 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Question: If the Shanghai Tower's height were increased by 20%, and the Ostankino Tower's height grew by 50%, which tower would stand the tallest?

search(Shanghai Tower)
Observation: The Shanghai Tower[a] is a 128-story, 632-meter-tall (2,073 ft) megatall skyscraper located in Lujiazui, Pudong, Shanghai.[10] It is the tallest building in China and the world's third-tallest building by height to architectural top. It is the tallest and largest LEED Platinum certified building in the world since 2015. It was also the second tallest-building in the world, from 2015 to 2021, until the completion of the Merdeka 118, which surpassed it by 49 meters (160 feet). It had the world's fastest elevators at a top speed of 20.5 meters per second (74 km/h; 46 mph) until 2017,[11][12]  when it was surpassed by the Guangzhou CTF Finance Center, with its top speed of 21 meters per second (76 km/h; 47 mph).[13]. Designed by the international design firm Gensler and owned by the Shanghai Municipal Government,[2] it is the tallest of the world's first triple-adjacent supertall buildings in Pudong, the other two being the Jin Mao Tower and the Shanghai World Financial Center.

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
The Amazon rainforest,[a] also called the Amazon jungle or Amazonia, is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq mi),[2] of which 6,000,000 km2 (2,300,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest.[3] This region includes territory belonging to nine nations and 3,344 indigenous territories.. The majority of the forest, 60%, is in Brazil, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. Four nations have "Amazonas" as the name of one of their first-level administrative regions, and France uses the name "Guiana Amazonian Park" for French Guiana's protected rainforest area. The Amazon represents over half of the total area of remaining rainforests on Earth,[4] and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees in about 16,000 species.[5].

The Congolian rainforests (French: Forêts tropicales congolaises) are a broad belt of lowland tropical moist broadleaf forests which extend across the basin of the Congo River and its tributaries in Central Africa.. The Congolian rainforest is the world's second-largest tropical forest, after the Amazon rainforest. It covers over 500,000,000 acres (2,000,000 km2) across six countries and contains a quarter of the world's remaining tropical forest.[1][2] The Congolian forests cover southeastern Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of the Congo, the northern and central Democratic Republic of the Congo, and portions of southern and central Africa. The Congolian rainforest is home to a large number of flora and fauna, including more than 10,000 species of plants and over 10,000 species of animals. It is estimated[by whom?] that the region contains more than a quarter of the world’s plant species and is home to one of the world’s most threatened primate species, the western lowland gorilla.[3] There are also a number of other species of primates, including the chimpanzee, black colobus monkey, red colobus monkey, and olive baboon..

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: If Mount Everest's height were halved and Mount Kilimanjaro's height were doubled, what would be the difference in their height?
search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 82 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
search(Mount Kilimanjaro)
Observation: Mount Kilimanjaro (/ˌkɪlɪmənˈdʒɑːroʊ/)[4] is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895 m (19,341 ft) above sea level and about 4,900 m (16,100 ft) above its plateau base.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
Main five oceans division:. The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth's five oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean, or, depending on the definition, to Antarctica in the south, and is bounded by the continents of Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.. At 165,250,000 square kilometers (63,800,000 square miles) in area (as defined with a southern Antarctic border), the Pacific Ocean is the largest division of the World Ocean and the hydrosphere and covers approximately 46% of Earth's water surface and about 32% of the planet's total surface area, larger than its entire land area (148,000,000 km2 (57,000,000 sq mi)).[1] The centers of both the water hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere, as well as the oceanic pole of inaccessibility, are in the Pacific Ocean. Ocean circulation (caused by the Coriolis effect) subdivides it[2] into two largely independent volumes of water that meet at the equator, the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean (or more loosely the South Seas).

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: If Mount Everest's height were halved and Mount Kilimanjaro's height were doubled, what would be the difference in their height?
search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 82 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
search(Mount Kilimanjaro)
Observation: Mount Kilimanjaro (/ˌkɪlɪmənˈdʒɑːroʊ/)[4] is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895 m (19,341 ft) above sea level and about 4,900 m (16,100 ft) above its plateau base. It is the highest volcano in Africa and the Eastern Hemisphere.. Kilimanjaro is the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

Observation: 55°25′44″S 26°11′29″W﻿ / ﻿55.42889°S 26.19139°W﻿ / -55.42889; -26.19139. The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Observation: Main five oceans division:. The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth's five oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean, or, depending on the definition, to Antarctica in the south, and is bounded by the continents of Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.. At 165,250,000 square kilometers (63,800,000 square miles) in area (as defined with a southern Antarctic border), the Pacific Ocean is the largest division of the World Ocean and the hydrosphere and covers approximately 46% of Earth's water surface and about 32% of the planet's total surface area, larger than its entire land area (148,000,000 km2 (57,000,000 sq mi)).[1] The centers of both the water hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere, as well as the oceanic pole of inaccessibility, are in the Pacific Ocean. Ocean circulation (caused by the Coriolis effect) subdivides it[2] into two largely independent volumes of water that meet at the equator, the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean (or more loosely the South Seas).

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: If Mount Everest's height were halved and Mount Kilimanjaro's height were doubled, what would be the difference in their height?
search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 82 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
search(Mount Kilimanjaro)
Observation: Mount Kilimanjaro (/ˌkɪlɪmənˈdʒɑːroʊ/)[4] is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895 m (19,341 ft) above sea level and about 4,900 m (16,100 ft) above its plateau base. It is the highest volcano in Africa and the Eastern Hemisphere.. Kilimanjaro is the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Context:
The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the North Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, parallel to and north of Puerto Rico, where the oceanic trench reaches the deepest points in the Atlantic Ocean. The trench is associated with a complex transition from the Lesser Antilles frontal subduction zone between the South American plate and Caribbean plate to the oblique subduction zone and the strike-slip transform fault zone between the North American plate and Caribbean plate, which extends from the Puerto Rico Trench at the Puerto Rico–Virgin Islands microplate through the Cayman Trough at the Gonâve microplate to the Middle America Trench at the Cocos plate.[1][2][3][4][5][6]. Constituting the deepest points in the Atlantic Ocean, the trench is 810 kilometres (503 mi) long[7] and has a maximum documented depth between  8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[8] and 8,740 metres (28,675 ft).[7][9] The deepest point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[10] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[11][12][13] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[14][15][16]. Scientific studies have concluded that an earthquake occurring along this fault zone could generate a significant tsunami.[17] The island of Puerto Rico, which lies immediately to the south of the fault zone and the trench, suffered a destructive tsunami soon after the 1918 San Fermín earthquake.. The Puerto Rico Trench is located at a boundary between two plates that pass each other along a transform boundary with only a small component of subduction.

It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.[citation needed] The temperature at the bottom is 1 to 4 °C (34 to 39 °F).[4].

search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the North Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, parallel to and north of Puerto Rico, where the oceanic trench reaches the deepest points in the Atlantic Ocean. The trench is associated with a complex transition from the Lesser Antilles frontal subduction zone between the South American plate and Caribbean plate to the oblique subduction zone and the strike-slip transform fault zone between the North American plate and Caribbean plate, which extends from the Puerto Rico Trench at the Puerto Rico–Virgin Islands microplate through the Cayman Trough at the Gonâve microplate to the Middle America Trench at the Cocos plate.[1][2][3][4][5][6]. Constituting the deepest points in the Atlantic Ocean, the trench is 810 kilometres (503 mi) long[7] and has a maximum documented depth between  8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[8] and 8,740 metres (28,675 ft).[7][9] The deepest point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[10] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[11][12][13] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[14][15][16]. Scientific studies have concluded that an earthquake occurring along this fault zone could generate a significant tsunami.[17] The island of Puerto Rico, which lies immediately to the south of the fault zone and the trench, suffered a destructive tsunami soon after the 1918 San Fermín earthquake.. The Puerto Rico Trench is located at a boundary between two plates that pass each other along a transform boundary with only a small component of subduction.

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: If Mount Everest's height were halved and Mount Kilimanjaro's height were doubled, what would be the difference in their height?
search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 82 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
search(Mount Kilimanjaro)
Observation: Mount Kilimanjaro (/ˌkɪlɪmənˈdʒɑːroʊ/)[4] is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895 m (19,341 ft) above sea level and about 4,900 m (16,100 ft) above its plateau base. It is the highest volcano in Africa and the Eastern Hemisphere.. Kilimanjaro is the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

The Burj Khalifa[a] (known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration) is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft, or just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding antenna, but including a 242.6 m spire)[2] of  828 m (2,717 ft), it is the world's tallest structure. It has also held the record of the tallest building in the world since its topping out in 2009, surpassing the Taipei 101, the holder of that status since 2004.[3][4]. Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete and some of the structural steel for the building originated from the Palace of the Republic in East Berlin, the seat of the former East German parliament.[5] The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai.

Observation: The Burj Khalifa[a] (known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration) is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft, or just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding antenna, but including a 242.6 m spire)[2] of  828 m (2,717 ft), it is the world's tallest structure. It has also held the record of the tallest building in the world since its topping out in 2009, surpassing the Taipei 101, the holder of that status since 2004.[3][4]. Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete and some of the structural steel for the building originated from the Palace of the Republic in East Berlin, the seat of the former East German parliament.[5] The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai.

 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: If Mount Everest's height were halved and Mount Kilimanjaro's height were doubled, what would be the difference in their height?
search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 82 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
search(Mount Kilimanjaro)
Observation: Mount Kilimanjaro (/ˌkɪlɪmənˈdʒɑːroʊ/)[4] is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895 m (19,341 ft) above sea level and about 4,900 m (16,100 ft) above its plateau base. It is the highest volcano in Africa and the Eastern Hemisphere.. Kilimanjaro is the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

The Sonoran Desert (Spanish: Desierto de Sonora) is a hot desert and ecoregion in North America that covers the northwestern Mexican states of Sonora, Baja California, and Baja California Sur, as well as part of the Southwestern United States (in Arizona and California). It is the hottest desert in Mexico.[3]   It has an area of 260,000 square kilometers (100,000 sq mi).. In phytogeography, the Sonoran Desert is within the Sonoran floristic province of the Madrean region of southwestern North America, part of the Holarctic realm of the northern Western Hemisphere. The desert contains a variety of unique endemic plants and animals, notably, the saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) and organ pipe cactus (Stenocereus thurberi).. The Sonoran Desert is clearly distinct from nearby deserts (e.g., the Great Basin, Mojave, and Chihuahuan deserts) because it provides subtropical warmth in winter and two seasons of rainfall (in contrast, for example, to the Mojave's dry summers and cold winters).

It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: If Mount Everest's height were halved and Mount Kilimanjaro's height were doubled, what would be the difference in their height?
search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 82 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhɛrə/) is a desert spanning across North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[2][3][4]. The name "Sahara" is derived from Arabic: صَحَارَى, romanized: ṣaḥārā /sˤaħaːraː/, a broken plural form of ṣaḥrā' (صَحْرَاء /sˤaħraːʔ/), meaning "desert".[5][6][7][8]. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[1]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.

search(Sonoran Desert)
Observation: The Sonoran Desert (Spanish: Desierto de Sonora) is a hot desert and ecoregion in North America that covers the northwestern Mexican states of Sonora, Baja California, and Baja California Sur, as well as part of the Southwestern United States (in Arizona and California). It is the hottest desert in Mexico.[3]   It has an area of 260,000 square kilometers (100,000 sq mi).. In phytogeography, the Sonoran Desert is within the Sonoran floristic province of the Madrean region of southwestern North America, part of the Holarctic realm of the northern Western Hemisphere. The desert contains a variety of unique endemic plants and animals, notably, the saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) and organ pipe cactus (Stenocereus thurberi).. The Sonoran Desert is clearly distinct from nearby deserts (e.g., the Great Basin, Mojave, and Chihuahuan deserts) because it provides subtropical warmth in winter and two seasons of rainfall (in contrast, for example, to the Mojave's dry summers and cold winters).

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
The Yangtze or Yangzi (English:  /ˈjæŋtsi/ or /ˈjɑːŋtsi/ simplified Chinese: 长江; traditional Chinese: 長江; pinyin: Cháng Jiāng; lit. 'long river') is the longest river in Eurasia and the third-longest in the world. It rises at Jari Hill in the Tanggula Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau and flows 6,300 km (3,915 mi) in a generally easterly direction to the East China Sea.[8] It is the fifth-largest primary river by discharge volume in the world. Its drainage basin comprises one-fifth of the land area of China, and is home to nearly one-third of the country's population.[9]. The Yangtze has played a major role in the history, culture, and economy of China.

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 82 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Observation: The Yangtze or Yangzi (English:  /ˈjæŋtsi/ or /ˈjɑːŋtsi/ simplified Chinese: 长江; traditional Chinese: 長江; pinyin: Cháng Jiāng; lit. 'long river') is the longest river in Eurasia and the third-longest in the world. It rises at Jari Hill in the Tanggula Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau and flows 6,300 km (3,915 mi) in a generally easterly direction to the East China Sea.[8] It is the fifth-largest primary river by discharge volume in the world. Its drainage basin comprises one-fifth of the land area of China, and is home to nearly one-third of the country's population.[9]. The Yangtze has played a major role in the history, culture, and economy of China.

search(Mississippi River)
Observation: The Mississippi River[b] is the primary river of the largest drainage basin in the United States.[c][15][16] From its traditional source of Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota, it flows generally south for 2,340 miles (3,766 km)[16] to the Mississippi River Delta in the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains.[17] The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.[18][19] The main stem is entirely within the United States; the total drainage basin is 1,151,000 sq mi (2,980,000 km2), of which only about one percent is in Canada. The Mississippi ranks as the world's tenth-largest river by discharge flow, and the largest in North America..

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
Mount Everest, known officially and locally as Sagarmatha in Nepal or Qomolangma in Tibet,[note 4]  is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[4] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 8+1⁄2 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[5][6]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the standard route) and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest, known officially and locally as Sagarmatha in Nepal or Qomolangma in Tibet,[note 4]  is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[4] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 8+1⁄2 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[5][6]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the standard route) and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.

It is also the highest volcano in the Eastern Hemisphere and the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth.. Kilimanjaro's southern and eastern slopes served as the home of the Chagga Kingdoms until their abolition in 1963 by Julius Nyerere. The origin and meaning of the name Kilimanjaro is unknown, but may mean "mountain of greatness" or "unclimbable".

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈkɾistu ʁedẽˈtoʁ]) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.[1][2] It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.[3][4][5] Christ the Redeemer differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project organizers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide..

Context:
The Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue, with a height of 182 metres (597 feet),[3] near Kevadia in the state of Gujarat, India. It depicts Indian politician and independence activist Sardar Patel (1875–1950), who was the first deputy prime minister and home minister of independent India and an adherent of Mahatma Gandhi. Patel played a significant role in the political integration of India. The statue is on the Narmada River in the Kevadiya colony, facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam 100 kilometres (62 miles) southeast of the city of Vadodara.[4]. The project was first announced in 2010 by Narendra Modi, then Chief Minister of Gujarat, and construction started in October 2013 by Indian company Larsen & Toubro, with a total construction cost of ₹27 billion (US$422 million).[5] It was designed by Indian sculptor Ram V.

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 82 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

search(Christ the Redeemer)
Observation: Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈkɾistu ʁedẽˈtoʁ]) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.[1][2] It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.[3][4][5] Christ the Redeemer differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project organizers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide..

Observation: The Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue, with a height of 182 metres (597 feet),[3] near Kevadia in the state of Gujarat, India. It depicts Indian politician and independence activist Sardar Patel (1875–1950), who was the first deputy prime minister and home minister of independent India and an adherent of Mahatma Gandhi. Patel played a significant role in the political integration of India. The statue is on the Narmada River in the Kevadiya colony, facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam 100 kilometres (62 miles) southeast of the city of Vadodara.[4]. The project was first announced in 2010 by Narendra Modi, then Chief Minister of Gujarat, and construction started in October 2013 by Indian company Larsen & Toubro, with a total construction cost of ₹27 billion (US$422 million).[5] It was designed by Indian sculptor Ram V.

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

The Burj Khalifa[a] (known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration) is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft, or just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding antenna, but including a 242.6 m spire)[2] of  828 m (2,717 ft), it is the world's tallest structure. It has also held the record of the tallest building in the world since its topping out in 2009, surpassing the Taipei 101, the holder of that status since 2004.[3][4]. Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009.

Tokyo Skytree (東京スカイツリー, Tōkyō Sukaitsurī, [toːkʲoː sɯ̥kaitsɯriː] ⓘ), also written as Tokyo Sky Tree, is a broadcasting and observation tower, located in Sumida, Tokyo, Japan. It has been the tallest tower in Japan since opening in 2012,[2] and reached its full height of 634 meters (2,080 ft) in early 2011, making it the tallest tower in the world, displacing the Canton Tower,[3][4] and the third tallest structure in the world behind Merdeka 118 (678.9 m or 2,227 ft) and Burj Khalifa (829.8 m or 2,722 ft).[5][a]. The tower is the primary television and radio broadcast site for the Kantō region; the older Tokyo Tower no longer gives complete digital terrestrial television broadcasting coverage because it is surrounded by high-rise buildings. Skytree was completed on Leap Day, 29 February 2012, with the tower opening to the public on 22 May 2012.[6] The tower is the centrepiece of a large commercial development funded by Tobu Railway (which owns the complex) and a group of six terrestrial broadcasters headed by NHK. Trains stop at the adjacent Tokyo Skytree Station and nearby Oshiage Station.

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: If Mount Everest's height were halved and Mount Kilimanjaro's height were doubled, what would be the difference in their height?
search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 82 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
search(Mount Kilimanjaro)
Observation: Mount Kilimanjaro (/ˌkɪlɪmənˈdʒɑːroʊ/)[4] is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895 m (19,341 ft) above sea level and about 4,900 m (16,100 ft) above its plateau base. It is the highest volcano in Africa and the Eastern Hemisphere.. Kilimanjaro is the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Observation: Tokyo Skytree (東京スカイツリー, Tōkyō Sukaitsurī, [toːkʲoː sɯ̥kaitsɯriː] ⓘ), also written as Tokyo Sky Tree, is a broadcasting and observation tower, located in Sumida, Tokyo, Japan. It has been the tallest tower in Japan since opening in 2012,[2] and reached its full height of 634 meters (2,080 ft) in early 2011, making it the tallest tower in the world, displacing the Canton Tower,[3][4] and the third tallest structure in the world behind Merdeka 118 (678.9 m or 2,227 ft) and Burj Khalifa (829.8 m or 2,722 ft).[5][a]. The tower is the primary television and radio broadcast site for the Kantō region; the older Tokyo Tower no longer gives complete digital terrestrial television broadcasting coverage because it is surrounded by high-rise buildings. Skytree was completed on Leap Day, 29 February 2012, with the tower opening to the public on 22 May 2012.[6] The tower is the centrepiece of a large commercial development funded by Tobu Railway (which owns the complex) and a group of six terrestrial broadcasters headed by NHK. Trains stop at the adjacent Tokyo Skytree Station and nearby Oshiage Station.

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
The Amazon rainforest,[a] also called the Amazon jungle or Amazonia, is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq mi),[2] of which 6,000,000 km2 (2,300,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest.[3] This region includes territory belonging to nine nations and 3,344 indigenous territories.. The majority of the forest, 60%, is in Brazil, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. Four nations have "Amazonas" as the name of one of their first-level administrative regions, and France uses the name "Guiana Amazonian Park" for French Guiana's protected rainforest area. The Amazon represents over half of the total area of remaining rainforests on Earth,[4] and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees in about 16,000 species.[5].

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Question: If cheetah was 1.3 times slower, and greyhound was 1.5 times faster, which animal was faster?
search(cheetah)
Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: If Mount Everest's height were halved and Mount Kilimanjaro's height were doubled, what would be the difference in their height?
search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 82 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
search(Mount Kilimanjaro)
Observation: Mount Kilimanjaro (/ˌkɪlɪmənˈdʒɑːroʊ/)[4] is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895 m (19,341 ft) above sea level and about 4,900 m (16,100 ft) above its plateau base. It is the highest volcano in Africa and the Eastern Hemisphere.. Kilimanjaro is the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

Context:
The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's five oceanic divisions, with an area of about 85,133,000 km2 (32,870,000 sq mi).[2] It covers approximately 17% of Earth's surface and about 24% of its water surface area. During the Age of Discovery, it was known for separating the New World of the Americas (North America and South America) from the Old World of Afro-Eurasia (Africa, Asia, and Europe).. Through its separation of Afro-Eurasia from the Americas, the Atlantic Ocean has played a central role in the development of human society, globalization, and the histories of many nations. While the Norse were the first known humans to cross the Atlantic, it was the expedition of Christopher Columbus in 1492 that proved to be the most consequential. Columbus's expedition ushered in an age of exploration and colonization of the Americas by European powers, most notably Portugal, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom.

Context:
Main five oceans division:. The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five oceanic divisions.[1] It spans an area of approximately 14,060,000 km2 (5,430,000 sq mi) and is the coldest of the world's oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea.[2] It has also been described as an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean.[3][4] It is also seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing world ocean.. The Arctic Ocean includes the North Pole region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere and extends south to about 60°N. The Arctic Ocean is surrounded by Eurasia and North America, and the borders follow topographic features: the Bering Strait on the Pacific side and the Greenland Scotland Ridge on the Atlantic side.

Context:
Main five oceans division:. The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth's five oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean, or, depending on the definition, to Antarctica in the south, and is bounded by the continents of Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.. At 165,250,000 square kilometers (63,800,000 square miles) in area (as defined with a southern Antarctic border), the Pacific Ocean is the largest division of the World Ocean and the hydrosphere and covers approximately 46% of Earth's water surface and about 32% of the planet's total surface area, larger than its entire land area (148,000,000 km2 (57,000,000 sq mi)).[1] The centers of both the water hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere, as well as the oceanic pole of inaccessibility, are in the Pacific Ocean. Ocean circulation (caused by the Coriolis effect) subdivides it[2] into two largely independent volumes of water that meet at the equator, the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean (or more loosely the South Seas).

Context:
Main five oceans division:. The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean,[1][note 4] comprises the southernmost waters of the world ocean, generally taken to be south of 60° S latitude and encircling Antarctica.[5] With a size of 21,960,000 km2 (8,480,000 sq mi), it is the second-smallest of the five principal oceanic divisions, smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans, and larger than the Arctic Ocean.[6]. The maximum depth of the Southern Ocean, using the definition that it lies south of 60th parallel, was surveyed by the Five Deeps Expedition in early February 2019. The expedition's multibeam sonar team identified the deepest point at 60° 28' 46"S, 025° 32' 32"W, with a depth of 7,434 metres (24,390 ft). The expedition leader and chief submersible pilot Victor Vescovo, has proposed naming this deepest point the "Factorian Deep", based on the name of the crewed submersible DSV Limiting Factor, in which he successfully visited the bottom for the first time on February 3, 2019.[7].

Joining prompt:
 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

Observation: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: If Mount Everest's height were halved and Mount Kilimanjaro's height were doubled, what would be the difference in their height?
search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 82 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Question: After the Atlantic Ocean increased in size by 10% and the Arctic Ocean decreased by 15%, what is the ratio of the size of the largest ocean to the smallest ocean?

search(Atlantic Ocean)
Observation: The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's five oceanic divisions, with an area of about 85,133,000 km2 (32,870,000 sq mi).[2] It covers approximately 17% of Earth's surface and about 24% of its water surface area. During the Age of Discovery, it was known for separating the New World of the Americas (North America and South America) from the Old World of Afro-Eurasia (Africa, Asia, and Europe).. Through its separation of Afro-Eurasia from the Americas, the Atlantic Ocean has played a central role in the development of human society, globalization, and the histories of many nations. While the Norse were the first known humans to cross the Atlantic, it was the expedition of Christopher Columbus in 1492 that proved to be the most consequential. Columbus's expedition ushered in an age of exploration and colonization of the Americas by European powers, most notably Portugal, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom.

Observation: Main five oceans division:. The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five oceanic divisions.[1] It spans an area of approximately 14,060,000 km2 (5,430,000 sq mi) and is the coldest of the world's oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea.[2] It has also been described as an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean.[3][4] It is also seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing world ocean.. The Arctic Ocean includes the North Pole region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere and extends south to about 60°N. The Arctic Ocean is surrounded by Eurasia and North America, and the borders follow topographic features: the Bering Strait on the Pacific side and the Greenland Scotland Ridge on the Atlantic side.

search(Pacific Ocean)
Observation: Main five oceans division:. The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth's five oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean, or, depending on the definition, to Antarctica in the south, and is bounded by the continents of Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.. At 165,250,000 square kilometers (63,800,000 square miles) in area (as defined with a southern Antarctic border), the Pacific Ocean is the largest division of the World Ocean and the hydrosphere and covers approximately 46% of Earth's water surface and about 32% of the planet's total surface area, larger than its entire land area (148,000,000 km2 (57,000,000 sq mi)).[1] The centers of both the water hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere, as well as the oceanic pole of inaccessibility, are in the Pacific Ocean. Ocean circulation (caused by the Coriolis effect) subdivides it[2] into two largely independent volumes of water that meet at the equator, the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean (or more loosely the South Seas).
search(Indian Ocean)
Observation: Main five oceans division:. The Indian Ocean is the third-largest of the world's five oceanic divisions, covering 70,560,000 km2 (27,240,000 sq mi) or approximately 20% of the water area of Earth's surface.[4] It is bounded by Asia to the north, Africa to the west and Australia to the east. To the south it is bounded by the Southern Ocean or Antarctica, depending on the definition in use.[5] The Indian Ocean has large marginal or regional seas, including the Andaman Sea, the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the Laccadive Sea.. Geologically, the Indian Ocean is the youngest of the oceans, and it has distinct features such as narrow continental shelves. Its average depth is 3,741 m.
search(Southern Ocean)
Observation: Main five oceans division:. The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean,[1][note 4] comprises the southernmost waters of the world ocean, generally taken to be south of 60° S latitude and encircling Antarctica.[5] With a size of 21,960,000 km2 (8,480,000 sq mi), it is the second-smallest of the five principal oceanic divisions, smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans, and larger than the Arctic Ocean.[6]. The maximum depth of the Southern Ocean, using the definition that it lies south of 60th parallel, was surveyed by the Five Deeps Expedition in early February 2019. The expedition's multibeam sonar team identified the deepest point at 60° 28' 46"S, 025° 32' 32"W, with a depth of 7,434 metres (24,390 ft). The expedition leader and chief submersible pilot Victor Vescovo, has proposed naming this deepest point the "Factorian Deep", based on the name of the crewed submersible DSV Limiting Factor, in which he successfully visited the bottom for the first time on February 3, 2019.[7].

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.

 Solve a question answering task with interleaving Observation, Thought, and Action steps. Answer should always be a single item and MUST not be multiple choices.
Thought step can reason about the observations in a few words. You MUST keep it short.
Action can be only one type: (1) Finish(answer): returns the answer and finishes the task.     - Final answer MUST NOT contain any description, and must be short (e.g. Yes/No, numbers, entity names, etc.)
    - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference.
    - If you are asked about a value (e.g. ratio, difference, average, ...), it has to be a number, not a description. For instance, when you are asked about the ratio of the height of Mount Everest and the height of Mount Kilimanjaro, you must return the ratio (e.g. 1.2), not the name of the mountain (e.g. Mount Everest to Mount Kilimanjaro).

Here are some examples:

It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail..
search(greyhound)
Observation: The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.. Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.[2][3]. The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[4][5][6] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[7][8].

Question: If Mount Everest's height were halved and Mount Kilimanjaro's height were doubled, what would be the difference in their height?
search(Mount Everest)
Observation: Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 82 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
search(Mount Kilimanjaro)
Observation: Mount Kilimanjaro (/ˌkɪlɪmənˈdʒɑːroʊ/)[4] is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895 m (19,341 ft) above sea level and about 4,900 m (16,100 ft) above its plateau base. It is the highest volcano in Africa and the Eastern Hemisphere.. Kilimanjaro is the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth.

Question: With the Sahara Desert's area reduced by 33% and the Kalahari Desert's area magnified by 52%, which one covers more ground?
search(Sahara Desert)
Observation: The Sahara (/səˈhɑːrə/, /səˈhærə/) is a desert spanning North Africa. With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]. The name "Sahara" is derived from the Arabic word for "desert" in the feminine irregular form, the singular ṣaḥra' (صحراء /ˈsˤaħra/), plural ṣaḥārā (صَحَارَى /ˈsˤaħaːraː/),[4][5][6][7] ṣaḥār (صَحَار), ṣaḥrāwāt (صَحْرَاوَات), ṣaḥār).. The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.search(Kalahari Desert)
Observation: The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900,000 square kilometres (350,000 sq mi), covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.. It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means "vast place".. Kalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.. The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand BP (before present), especially after 17,500 BP.[2].math(what the area of the Sahara Desert in km^2 if it was reduced by 33%?)

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.
search(Mariana Trench)
Observation: The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.[a]. At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%.
search(Puerto Rico Trench)
Observation: The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench, the deepest in the Atlantic, is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America.. The trench is 800 kilometres (497 mi) long[1] and has a maximum depth of 8,376 metres (27,480 ft)[2] or 5.20 miles. This constitutes the single deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean. This point is commonly referred to as the Milwaukee Deep, with the Brownson Deep naming the seabed surrounding it.[3] However, more recently, the latter term has also been used interchangeably with the former to refer to this point.[4][5][6] The exact point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar in 2018, and then directly visited and its depth verified by the crewed submersible Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) piloted by Victor Vescovo.[7][8][9].math(what is the depth difference between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench in meters?)

The South Sandwich Trench is a deep arcuate trench in the South Atlantic Ocean lying 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the east of the South Sandwich Islands. It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.. The deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as 55°25.12′S 26°24.28′W﻿ / ﻿55.41867°S 26.40467°W﻿ / -55.41867; -26.40467﻿ (Meteor Deep) at a depth of 8,202 metres (26,909 ft).
search(Sunda Trench)
Observation: The Sunda Trench, earlier known as and sometimes still indicated as the Java Trench,[1] is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) long with a maximum depth of 7,290 metres (23,920 feet).[2] Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade.[3] This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.[4].math(what is the depth difference between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench in meters?)

Answer the Question based on the Context. When you write down a expression, it MUST ONLY consists of numbers and operators. Here are some guidelines that you will be PANALIZED if you don't follow:

  - When you are asked for differences, you consider the absolute value of the difference. Difference of two numbers is always positive.For instance, the difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not -1.
  - When you are applying operations (e.g. difference, summation, ratio, etc.) between multiple values in the Context, you must unify the units of those numbers. For instance, you cannot add 1 meter to 1 foot.
     - You must pick the values in the same units if all the values are available in the same units.
     - If not, you must convert them to the same units before applying the operation.
  - You MUST strictly follow the unit (e.g. meter, kilometer, million, etc.) you were asked.
     - If the Context has the numbers in same units as the question, you can directly use them.
     - If the Context has the numbers in different units than the question, you must convert them to the units asked in the question.For example, if the question asks for the distance between two cities in kilometers, but the Context has the distance in miles, you must convert the distance to kilometers.
  - If you are asked about a particular number in millions, billions, or any other unit, the number should be written without specifying the unit. For example, if you are asked for 100 millions, it should be written as 100, not 100 million or 100,000,000.
 - Never introduce a variable. For instance "gazelle_max_speed * 1.4" is not allowed. Pick up a correct number from the given context.
